* 1: Developer spends significant time debugging elementary syntax or concepts


### Ruby Style
* 4: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity

* 1: Developer writes code that is difficult to understand

### Blocks & Enumerations
* 4: Developer is able to consistently select and implement the best-choice enumerator methods with blocks

* 1: Developer is not able to use enumerator methods or blocks to solve the problem at hand

### Testing
